The hardest part of AI adoption isn't the technology.

It's getting people to trust something they can't see working.

I've watched teams spend months building the perfect AI solution.
Then it sits unused because nobody changed the actual workflow around it.

The fix is embarrassingly simple:
Start with one person. One task. One win.

Don't roll out to the whole team.
Find your most frustrated employee — the one drowning in repetitive work.
Automate their biggest headache first.

When they start telling others "this thing actually works," adoption takes care of itself.

Trust spreads faster than training decks.
