## Post 0a - Feb 9, 2026 (215 impressions in 2hrs, tracking) — Personal Profile
**Type:** Text only

Over $1,500 a month on SaaS.
HubSpot. Fireflies. Notion. Buffer. PandaDocs.
A talent portal.
Six-person team.

The tools weren't bad.
They were built for everyone.

So we built our own:
→ CRM
→ Call Transcription
→ Project Management
→ Social Dashboard
→ Candidate Tracker
→ SEO Dashboard

Each one built for how we actually work.
Dashboards match our exact workflows.
AI employees skip the UI and hit the API.

Same data. Two paths.
Humans use dashboards. AI uses APIs.
One costs a seat license. The other costs an API call.

Monthly compute: $200.

The expensive part of SaaS was never the software.
It was paying for someone else's idea of how you should work.

## Post 0b - Feb 9, 2026 — Company Page (HummingAgent)
**Type:** Photo from Woven Innovation Summit

In Atlanta this week for the Woven Innovation Summit.

Healthcare is one of the last industries where AI can't just be impressive. It has to be compliant. Private. Trustworthy.

The conversations here aren't about what AI can do.
They're about what AI is allowed to do.

That's the harder problem. And the bigger opportunity.

Most AI tools start by asking you to send your data somewhere else. Healthcare can't do that. Patient workflows. Clinical notes. Billing data. None of it can leave your environment.

That constraint changes everything.

We've been building toward that reality. Private GPT. Secure infrastructure. AI employees that handle real workflows without your data ever leaving your walls.

Same capabilities. Zero exposure.

The companies that win in healthcare AI won't be the ones with the flashiest models. They'll be the ones that earned trust first.

Presented Humming Agent AI to 30+ founders and investors on Wednesday.

Hardest question from the room
"Are you a tech company or a services company?"

Still figuring that out and learning fast.
Here's what we learned 👇

We pitched Humming Agent AI to 30+ founders and investors on Wednesday.

Hardest question we got
"Are you a tech company or a services company?"

Honest answer
Both. And we're still figuring it out.

What we do know
One Super Park deployment
• Cut repetitive questions by 70%
• Dramatically reduced LLM costs

That's real production proof. Not a demo.

Big takeaway from the room
Most AI projects fail because companies try to automate chaos.
We map workflows first. Then we deploy AI.

Huge thanks to Peter Rothschild and PitchBoulder for the direct, no-BS feedback.

Something I didn't expect after leaving big companies:

Speed removes ego.

When feedback takes weeks, you defend your ideas.
When it takes days, you fix them.
When it takes hours, you stop getting attached.

You stop building to prove you're smart.
You start building to solve the problem.

That shift changes everything.
Less storytelling.
More listening.

It's uncomfortable at first.
Then you realize it's the fastest way to build what people actually use.

Build vs buy is the wrong question.

Most companies spend months comparing vendors.
Feature matrices. Demo calls. Procurement reviews.

Then they buy something that does not fit how they actually work.

The better question is what do we need to learn before we commit.

Build something ugly in two weeks.
Watch it break.
See what your team actually uses.

Sometimes that leads to buying the right tool with confidence.
Sometimes the ugly version already solves 80 percent of the problem.

Either way you learned fast
and avoided a six figure mistake.

That is the work we do at HummingAgent.
Build the ugly version first.

We wrapped the season at Broncos vs. Chargers with Pax8, connecting with partners and operators who are actively exploring AI that actually works.

Huge thanks to Nate Raaz and the crew: Ryan McCormick, Shawn Kercher, Joey Kercher, Kelly Kercher.

From there, it was off to CES to see what's next in AI and automation.

What we're building at HummingAgent is practical by design. 
AI agents, voice workflows, and secure integrations that fit into how businesses already operate.

Less busy work for SMB teams.
Cleaner ops.
Faster customer responses.
With human control where it matters.

Not replacing teams.
Not adding more tools to manage.

If you're exploring AI this year, what's the first workflow you'd automate?

CES reinforced something I've seen all year.

Most AI looks incredible in a demo.
Very little of it survives in production.

What stood out wasn't model quality.
It was how few products actually forced the next action.

If AI doesn't
• Trigger a workflow
• Update a system of record
• Reduce discretion at decision points

It's just insight. Not leverage.

The real winners won't be the flashiest demos from CES.
They'll be the systems that quietly close loops inside real businesses.

Curious what others noticed this week.

Automation follows instructions. Agentic AI figures out what to do next. That difference sounds subtle: it isn't.

I've been on a dozen sales calls this month and every single one had the same problem hiding in plain sight: they're bleeding leads.

A prospect fills out a form at 9pm. Someone follows up at 2pm the next day. By then, they've already talked to a competitor.

A warm lead goes cold because the follow-up email got buried in a to-do list. A repeat customer signals they're ready to buy again, but nobody notices because it's trapped in a spreadsheet nobody checks.

Regular automation can't fix this. It only follows the script you gave it.

Agentic AI spots the gap, qualifies the lead, sends a personalized follow-up, routes it to the right person, and flags it if nothing happens in 24 hours: all without you babysitting it.

The businesses winning in 2025 aren't the ones with the biggest teams. They're the ones who stopped letting money leak through broken processes.

How many leads slipped through your cracks this month?

Every morning used to start with detective work: five dashboards, endless tabs, and way too many "what broke overnight?" surprises.

When you manage SEO for multiple sites, problems aren't "if" : they're "when."

Pages fall out of Google's index. Rankings drop for no clear reason. A sudden site speed dip quietly kills conversions. And you often don't catch it until the damage is done.

We got tired of finding problems late, so we built something for ourselves : an SEO monitoring system that actually watches what matters:
• Real-time alerts for indexing and keyword changes
• Instant notifications when site speed tanks
• Attention metrics that show what's thriving (and what's not)

Now we catch issues as they happen across Humming Agent AI, AirFresh Marketing, K3 Technology, and our client websites. No more dashboard archaeology. Just clean, actionable data every morning.

We built it because we needed it. But it turns out others need it too.

If you're juggling SEO across multiple sites and want early access, DM me (we're opening up a small beta soon.)

Sensitive company info slips into public AI chat tools every day: often without anyone noticing. That includes strategy docs, client notes, even confidential IP. Suddenly, data that should stay inside is out of your control and stored who-knows-where.

There's a better way: Private AI chat puts the power of LLMs inside your secure environment. That means zero data shared, full compliance, and complete control on your turf.

It's not just about protecting secrets. You get:
• On-prem or cloud deploy: nothing leaves your walls
• Trust intact: no data leaks
• Audit trails, RBAC, bank-grade encryption
• Controls so your AI matches your business needs

I just broke down how PrivateGPT-style systems actually work (in under 1 minute) : and why more companies are moving away from public AI tools in favor of privacy-first solutions.

Catch the details: https://lnkd.in/gFtvXHk5

If you care about compliance, trust, or innovation, privacy matters. Own your data. Own your AI.

Everyone's chasing the next big AI model, but here's the reality: the AI release cycle just went into overdrive.

In the past 7 days alone:

𝑮𝒓𝒐𝒌 𝟒.𝟏 (Nov 17) : Top-ranked in blind testing, 65% fewer hallucinations, now with a free tier. 
𝑮𝑷𝑻-𝟓.𝟏 (Nov 12) : Adaptive reasoning, 50–80% faster on simple tasks, 8 personality presets for different use cases.

Plus two more reshaping the landscape:

𝑪𝒍𝒂𝒖𝒅𝒆 𝑺𝒐𝒏𝒏𝒆𝒕 𝟒.𝟓 (Sept 29) : 77.2% on SWE-bench, 30+ hours of autonomous coding.
𝑮𝒆𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒊 𝟑 (spotted in testing) : Rumored 1M-token context, release expected soon.

So what does this mean for your workflow? The old "which AI should I use?" debate is officially dead. Every top model is incredible. The new question is which fits your process:

Need fact accuracy? → 𝑮𝒓𝒐𝒌 𝟒.𝟏
Need speed + reasoning? → 𝑮𝑷𝑻-𝟓.𝟏
Need autonomous coding? → 𝑪𝒍𝒂𝒖𝒅𝒆 𝑺𝒐𝒏𝒏𝒆𝒕 𝟒.𝟓
Need massive context? → Wait for 𝑮𝒆𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒊 𝟑

The hype's behind us. These tools actually deliver.

Thinking about AI but feeling overwhelmed by all the options? You're not alone. For most SMBs, the smartest move isn't going all-in overnight — it's starting small with a pilot, learning fast, and scaling what actually works.

Pilots give your team space to test AI in real workflows, spot quick wins, and smooth out bumps with minimal risk. You get real outcomes, like saving 15+ hours a week or improving response times, without betting the whole farm.

At Humming Agent AI, we've seen clients unlock real ROI by piloting customer support automations or repetitive process workflows, then scaling once they see the impact. No stress, no big commitments — just steady progress.

If you're looking to try AI without the headaches, let's talk about piloting before scaling. How are you experimenting with AI in your business right now?

AI is finally moving past the hype, and starting to deliver real business impact.

This month's biggest shifts aren't about flashy launches, but about privacy-first automation, smarter workflows, and tools teams can actually use. Apple's latest push for on-device, privacy-minded AI makes one thing clear: secure automation is no longer optional, not just for tech giants, but for any business handling sensitive data (yes, even SMBs).

Meanwhile, generative AI is quietly reinventing routine work:
✅ instant document processing
✅ predictive maintenance
✅ customer conversations that actually get things done

Here's the real takeaway: businesses don't need shiny features : they need tools that fit, automate, and solve real pain points. That's why at HummingAgent.ai, we focus on streamlining, not overwhelming. We're making automation practical, secure, and tailored to what teams really need.

Curious how modern AI can make a difference for your workflow? Let's chat about what's genuinely working : and how you can put today's smartest tech to work for your team.

Everyone's chasing the next big AI tool, but the real advantage is in how well yours work together.

Most teams don't need more AI tools — they need better integration between the ones they already have.

The biggest unlock I've seen lately: connecting customer data — CRM, support tickets, email threads, call transcripts, and purchase history — directly to an AI agent that actually knows your clients.

We helped a client save 15 hours a week by connecting their ticketing system to an AI agent — no new tools, just smarter integration.

Start small. Pick one workflow that repeats daily — automate it, then measure the hours saved.

Consistency beats complexity when it comes to AI adoption.

Tired of busy work?
That's the problem we built Humming Agent AI to solve.

Most teams spend hours every week managing the repetitive parts of work — tracking vendors, updating CRMs, coordinating follow-ups, or keeping systems in sync.
All necessary. None meaningful.

Humming Agent AI helps automate that layer — the stuff that keeps things moving but slows teams down.
Private AI agents that work securely in your environment — no noise, no gimmicks.

This isn't another chatbot.
It's practical automation that gets real work done.

The Quiet Revolution: AI Agents That Just… Work.

Most AI agents never make it past the proof-of-concept stage.
We're changing that.

At HummingAgent, we're building Private GPTs in Azure and AWS for companies that don't want their data training public models — and deploying agentic workflows that automate research, CRM updates, and real operations safely behind the firewall.

These aren't experiments.
They're production systems running today.

If you're curious how businesses are quietly using AI agents that actually work, here's what we've learned:
